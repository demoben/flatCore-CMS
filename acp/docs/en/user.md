### User ###

### Create new Accounts/User

There are two ways in which user accounts can be created. Users can register themselves through the frontend (if this feature is enabled in the settings) or the user account can be created on the backend.

Users who register themselves on the frontend, must confirm their account information. They must click on the verification link which is automatically sent to their email address.

#### Rights Management

Any user or administrator can be equipped with different user rights.

* __User is Administrator__<br>This option gives the user access to the backend.
* __Edit Pages__<br>The user can create new pages.
* __Edit All Pages__<br>The user can edit all the pages. So even pages which he has not created himself.
* __Only own Pages__<br>If this option is enabled, the user can edit only those pages which he himself has created or which have been unlocked for him.
* __Upload Files__<br>The user is allowed to upload pictures and files.
* __Manage User__<br>The user can edit other accounts.<br>__Attention:__ Who can edit other accounts, of course, can give any user rights to himself.
* __Edit Preferences__<br>The user can change the system settings.
